# E-commerce Backend API

This repository contains the backend API for an e-commerce application, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides all essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing products, users, orders, and other core e-commerce entities.

## Technologies Used

*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL document database.
*   **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication and authorization.
*   **bcrypt:** For securely hashing passwords.
*   **Pre Hooks (Mongoose Middleware):** Used for data manipulation before saving to the database.

## Features

*   **Product Management:**
    *   Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
    *   Search and filter products by various criteria.
    *   Manage product categories and inventory.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Role-based access control (e.g., admin, customer).
    *   Secure password hashing using bcrypt.
    *   JWT-based authentication for protected routes.
*   **Order Management:**
    *   Create, Read, Update, and Delete orders.
    *   Track order status and fulfillment.
    *   Generate order summaries and invoices.
*   **Shopping Cart:**
    *   Add products to cart.
    *   Update cart quantities.
    *   Remove items from cart.
*   **[Other Features (e.g., Payment integration, Reviews and Ratings, Wishlist)]:** Add any other specific features your backend implements.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/narayxnnn/ecom-backend.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ecom-backend 
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the environment variables. See `.env.example` for a template.

    ```
    # Example .env file
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name  # Example MongoDB URL
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    # ... other environment variables
    ```

5.  Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or npm start depending on your scripts
    ```

## API Endpoints

(It's highly recommended to include a more detailed list of your API endpoints, including request methods, URLs, request bodies, and response formats. Consider using a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.)

Example:

*   `POST /api/v1/products`: Creates a new product.
*   `GET /api/v1/products`: Retrieves all products.
*   `GET /api/v1/products/:id`: Retrieves a specific product by ID.
*   `POST /api/v1/users/signup`: Registers a new user.
*   `POST /api/v1/users/login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT.

## Mongoose Pre Hooks

Mongoose pre hooks are used for the following:

*   **Password Hashing:** The `pre('save')` hook is used to hash user passwords using bcrypt before saving them to the database. This ensures that passwords are never stored in plain text.

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is included to prevent sensitive information and unnecessary files from being committed to the repository. It specifically ignores:

*   `node_modules/`: The Node.js dependencies.
*   `.env`: Environment variables containing sensitive information.
*   Any other files or directories specified in the `.gitignore` file.

## .env.example

This file shows the structure of the environment variables needed for the application. It should *not* contain actual sensitive data. Copy it to `.env` and fill in the correct values.
